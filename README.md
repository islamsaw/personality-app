# Notes : 
it's working and i understood the code 100%
the only thing i didn't get is when to split the widgets to make the app performance better ! 
what's next ?
we can replace the textbutton with a floatingactionbutton so the user can restart the quiz any time if he choose a wrong answer by mistake
